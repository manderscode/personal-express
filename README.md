# Immigrant Parent Love - Personal Express

This is an app that uses express on the server side for users to input their name and write a message about the way their parent(s) showcase their love without verbally expressing it.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned 

I was able to understand the server side more after building this app. I understand different ways of updating the user's messages for future projects. Building this app also made me really appreciate the little things my family does for me to show me their love without saying "I love you".
